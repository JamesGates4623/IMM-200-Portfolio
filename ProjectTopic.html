    1. What kind of website would you like to build? What kind of mobile app would you like to build?

</p>

<p>
    I would like to build a video game review website that shows what my opinions are on video games. For the mobile app, I would like to make an app that tells you who worked on the video games. For example, I would list the directors and voice actors.

<p>
    2. Who would your targeted audience be for the website?
</p>

<p>
    The target audience is anybody that likes to play video games.

    3. How have you created websites in the past? Examples – IMM 120 projects, personal websites, and websites for other people. Provide details on the topic, how many pages, what kind of navigation, if it was responsive… etc.
</p>

<p>
    I only made websites for IMM 120 class. My final project in that class had four different pages that you would be able to get to. The way to navigate this website was by clicking on the words to get to each section.
